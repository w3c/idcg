<h1>Inclusion and Diversity office hours</h1>
<section class="news">
<p>Borrowing the concept from college or university where instructors set aside time to be available to their students, some of us in the Inclusion and Diversity Community Group are volunteering to clear our calendar for some <strong>free open office hours</strong> each month, invite people to stop by our virtual individual office, to talk to people from under-represented groups who would like to get involved at the World Wide Web Consortium but don't really know where to start.</p>
<h2>Ground rules</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>No sales pitches, please.</li>
 	<li>No homework. We'll do our best to help you in 30 minutes, but can't commit to taking on homework after the call ended.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Arranging time to speak with our volunteers</h2>
<p>Each volunteer has a preferred way to manage their time and arrange times to talk with people. The following table lists our volunteers and their preferred contact methods.</p>
