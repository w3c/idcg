<h1>W3C Inclusion and Diversity Community Group open office hours</h1>
<section class="news">
<p>We want people with different experiences and perspectives to become part of the W3C, because without diverse voices in every part of our community we cannot lead the web to its full potential.</p>
<p>One way we hope to do this is by inviting people from under-represented communities to stop by and chat with members of the W3C community. We've borrowed the "open office hours" idea from colleges and universities where instructors set aside time each week to talk with their students. Members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/idcg">W3C Inclusion and Diversity Community Group (IDCG)</a> are holding open office hours to chat with people from under-represented groups who would like to know more
about the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and how to get involved, but do not know where to start.</p>
<h2>Code of conduct</h2>
<p>As with all W3C activities, everyone who takes part in these open office hours is expected to follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC)</a>.</p>
<h2>Arranging time to speak with our volunteers</h2>
<p>Each volunteer has a preferred way to manage their time and arrange times to talk with people. The following table lists our volunteers and their preferred contact methods.</p>
